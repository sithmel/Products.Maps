1.1 - September 05, 2007
------------------------

- Fixed the logic when to show layers.
  [fschulze]

  new interface and view which only has the 'enabled' attribute and which
  is accessible without restriction. This is now used as the condition in
  portal_javascripts.

  widget for it now uses two input fields.
  [fschulze]

  UK and China.
  [fschulze]

1.0 - May 03, 2007
------------------

- Changed the markup. All markers are in one definition list instead of
  one marker in one list. A dt with class="title" marks the beginning of
  a new marker.
  [fschulze]

- Added support for layers. The default is to take keywords as the name
  of the layer in which a marker is visible. Then you get a map control
  with checkboxes for each keyword and you can view/hide the markers with
  that.
